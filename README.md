# Driver Evolution
"Drivers" evolve to pass through a simple obstacle course. Using
an evolutionary algorithm, the drivers learn to avoid the obstacles
and make it to the checkpoint. Better performing drivers (closer to the 
checkpoint) will have more of their "genes" passed on to the next 
generation.
